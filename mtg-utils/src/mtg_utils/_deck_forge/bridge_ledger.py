"""Ledgered bridges (ADR-0039) — the sanctioned straggler-serving mechanism.

A **ledgered bridge** is a gap-gated, corpus-bounded, self-retiring text read
that serves a signal lane where the typed substrate genuinely cannot yet: a
grammar straggler, a dropped clause, a missing face, or an upstream parse
failure. Bridges exist so the legacy-IR deletion (ADR-0039 / task #80) never
drops a legacy-served member — each bridge keeps its laggard cards served
until the post-deletion grammar sprint (task #82) or a phase bump lands the
real structure.

Every bridge is REGISTERED here, never written inline in a lane. A row
carries:

* ``gap`` — the machine-checkable evidence the typed substrate still lacks
  the structure. This is what makes a bridge SELF-RETIRING: when a grammar
  verb / phase bump lands the structure, ``gap`` goes False, the bridge stops
  firing, and the convergence test flags the row for deletion.
* ``match`` — the bounded text/idiom read. ``census`` records the authored
  blast radius (how many corpus cards the pattern hits, at which phase tag),
  so a reviewer can see the bridge is a scalpel, not a regex lane.
* ``todo`` — the NAMED grammar TODO or upstream report that retires it. A
  bridge with no retirement path is a regex detector wearing a costume; the
  ledger forbids it by construction.

A bridge FIRES only when ``gap AND match`` — the gate guarantees a bridge
can never shadow (or fight) a real structural read of the same card.

**The convergence hook** is ``tests/mtg-utils/test_bridge_ledger.py``: for
every row and every pinned fixture card it asserts ``gap`` still holds (a
False ``gap`` fails RETIRE-READY: delete the row + its lane call, rewrite the
mechanism pin structural, keep the membership pin — the graduation rule) and
``match`` still hits (pattern rot fails loudly). Laggards stay visible at
every fixture regen; nothing retires silently.

Bridges mirror LEGACY's serving only — beyond-legacy breadth is the typed
substrate's job. A bridge that "could also" open a sibling lane records that
as a note for the grammar sprint instead of widening its own read.
