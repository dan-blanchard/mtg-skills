"""Resolve a Scryfall record to its Card IR by ``oracle_id`` (ADR-0027 / 0035).

``ranking.py`` and ``budgets.py`` cluster / role-classify a candidate by reading
its structured abilities instead of re-grepping oracle text. Both join the card
to the IR the same way the engine does (``engine._ir_index``): one memoized load
of the sidecar (oracle_id → :class:`Card`), then an ``oracle_id`` lookup per card.

The lookup degrades to ``None`` whenever the sidecar is absent / the wrong
version (``load_crosswalk_card_ir`` raises) or the card carries no ``oracle_id``
— so a no-IR deployment, or a synthetic test fixture with no oracle_id, simply
degrades gracefully in the caller. Memoized so a tune issuing many searches
never re-reads the sidecar.

ADR-0035/0039 — the crosswalk is the ONLY serving path (task #80 step 6 deleted
the ``MTG_SKILLS_CROSSWALK_SIGNALS`` cutover flag and the legacy projected-Card
revert path it gated):

* :func:`ir_for` (Seam B — the five dataclass-API consumers ``ranking`` /
  ``budgets`` / ``cut_check`` / ``metrics`` / ``bracket``) returns the
  crosswalk-backed :class:`Card` sidecar — ``None`` when that sidecar is
  unbuilt, NEVER a silent fall-through to a different builder's Card
  (ADR-0039 task #80 step 4).
* :func:`trees_for` (Seam A — the hybrid signal dispatch) resolves a record to
  its Layer-2 concept trees, ONE PER PHASE FACE RECORD (a DFC / split card
  shares one ``oracle_id`` across faces, each face a separate phase record —
  ADR-0035/0038 task #74), built lazily from phase's ``card-data.json`` + the
  committed mirror schema, keyed by ``oracle_id`` (cache-parallel to ir_for).
  Callers union signals across the returned trees; nothing merges the trees
  themselves (a merged multi-face tree would corrupt card-level reads like
  ``is_type`` / cmc that only make sense per-face). ADR-0038 W2c: phase emits
  NO record at all for some multi-face halves (every aftermath second half
  corpus-wide, plus one two-face split); the production caller threads the
  bulk (MTGJSON) record's ``card_faces`` in as ``bulk=`` so those get one
  additional TEXT-ONLY tree apiece, carrying the bulk face's oracle text
  verbatim with zero units — the bulk record is the text source of record
  when phase has nothing to parse at all."""
