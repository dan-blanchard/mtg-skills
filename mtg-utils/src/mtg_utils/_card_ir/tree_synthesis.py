"""ADR-0037 Stage-3b — the tree-synthesis Layer-2 stage (bucket-B signal folds).

Folding a lane mirror to a Tier-1 structural read (ADR-0036) leaves a **bucket-B**
tail: a genuine phase-parse gap where the clause survives only in the card's oracle
text (phase emits NO typed node the signal lane could read). Neither existing
Layer-2 stage can fill it:

* :mod:`overlay_corrections` (bucket b) only DECORATES existing concept-nodes; its
  substrate-purity invariant forbids ADDING a node.
* :mod:`dropped_clauses` (bucket c) synthesizes onto the compat ``Card`` (Seam B),
  which the Signal lanes never read.

This stage ADDS a synthetic :class:`ConceptNode` to the crosswalk tree for such a
gap. Each arm reads the whole-card oracle (``tree.oracle``) with a regex **once**
and, for a genuine gap, emits a synthetic concept-node whose ``concept`` / ``scope``
/ ``subject`` the lane reads structurally. The synthetic node carries a
:class:`SynthesizedNode` marker in its ``.node`` slot — provenance (the arm id + a
description), NOT phase substrate.

**Signal-path-only.** :func:`apply_tree_synthesis` runs AFTER
:func:`overlay_corrections.apply_overlay_corrections` in the
``extract_crosswalk_signals`` path ONLY — never in ``compat_card``. So the compat
Card, the five Seam-B consumer views, and the flag-OFF projection are all
unaffected: a bucket-B fold moves *signals* and nothing else (the signal-diff is
the whole gate).

**The purity invariant relaxes, precisely (see :mod:`_substrate_purity`).** It
changes from "the L1 node fingerprint is unchanged" to "every *phase* L1 node
present before is present after with the same identity; :class:`SynthesizedNode`
additions are allowed." ``l1_nodes`` filters out synthetic nodes, so the phase
fingerprint is still asserted exactly — adding a node is legal ONLY here and ONLY
as a tagged synthetic node.

**Convergence-tracked.** Each arm is keyed by id (:data:`SYNTHESIS_ARM_IDS`) so the
input-side convergence check retires it when phase begins parsing the clause
(ADR-0035 shrinking bridge). A synthesis arm is a bridge, not a permanent home.

# The aristocrats death payoff (OTHER creatures dying, CR 700.4) has a bucket-B
# tail phase emits NO typed death node for: the clause lives only in a trigger's
# raw DESCRIPTION or an untyped condition. Three genuine idiom families the
# structural Tier-1 arms miss, each read PER-CLAUSE (reminder-stripped, split on
# ``.;\n``) so a match is confined to ONE clause — the cross-clause false-positive
# class the mirror carried is thereby eliminated:
#
#   * MORBID condition — "if a creature died this turn" / "for each creature that
#     died this turn" (Feast, Inga Rune-Eyes, the Zubera-count payoffs) that phase
#     folds into an effect operand rather than a typed ZoneChangeCount. No
#     "whenever" gate: "died this turn" is an unambiguous death-count idiom.
#   * COMBAT-DAMAGE death — "whenever a creature dealt damage … this turn dies"
#     (Scythe of the Wretched, Unscythe, Vampiric Sliver): the damaged creature's
#     death, OTHER-creature death per CR 700.4.
#   * OTHER-creature death — "whenever another/a … creature|permanent … dies"
#     (Syr Konrad, Massacre Girl, Baeloth) and the subtype-tribal form ("whenever
#     another nontoken Human you control dies" — Jerren; Tentacle — The Watcher).
#
# The COMBAT / OTHER / SUBTYPE families are "whenever"-gated (a persistent death
# TRIGGER, not a one-shot "if it dies this way" rider — Cinder Cloud). Every family
# fires ONLY when NO structural death node is present (so it never double-counts a
# card a Tier-1 arm already reads) and ONLY for OTHER-creature death (a bare
# self-death "when ~ dies" — no "whenever", subject "this" — matches no family, so
# it is shed to ``self_death_payoff`` without an explicit veto). ~40 commander-legal
# corpus cards fire this arm across the three families (the pilot's single
# "another creature dies" idiom covered ~23).
