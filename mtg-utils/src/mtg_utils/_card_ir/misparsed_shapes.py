"""Shapes phase misparses, rewritten on the raw face records before strict load.

Beside the other raw-record corrections (``branches`` drops a branch phase
misreads, ``dropped_keywords`` restores a keyword it leaves out, ``shape_compat``
writes a renamed shape back in its old form): a row here is a clause phase types
as the wrong node, rewritten to the node phase types the same meaning as
elsewhere, so every read sees the clause the way it reads that node, with no read
taught a special case. Keyed on phase's structure, never the card's name or text.

* **A self-damage sweep.** "Each creature deals damage to itself equal to its
  power" (Solar Blaze, Wave of Reckoning; The Akroan War's chapter III, "Each
  tapped creature …") is parsed as the targeted form's damage effect with the
  target dropped. The targeted form ("Target creature deals damage to itself
  equal to its power" — Repentance) is a ``TargetOnly`` followed by
  ``DealDamage{amount: Power of Target, target: ParentTarget, damage_source:
  Target}``. Here the ``DealDamage`` heads its ability (an ``abilities`` entry or
  a trigger's ``execute``), so its ``ParentTarget`` names nothing and no read sees
  a population. Any object can deal damage (CR 120.2) and damage dealt to a
  creature is marked on it (120.3e), so each creature is marked with damage equal
  to its power, and one with toughness no greater than that is destroyed
  (704.5g): a sweep. It is rewritten to the ``DamageAll`` over every creature that
  phase types for "deals N damage to each creature", keeping phase's own
  ``amount`` and ``damage_source`` (each creature deals the damage, by its own
  power). The ``Power`` amount is the gate: a heading ``DealDamage`` of a fixed
  amount is "this creature deals N damage to itself" (Stuffy Doll; Vrondiss, Rage
  of Ancients), the card alone. The Akroan War's "tapped" is not in phase's
  record; it is read as every creature, which is a sweep either way.
  ``test_self_damage_sweep_canary`` fails once phase types the population itself.

Pure functions over plain dicts; nothing here reads the mirror or a tree.
