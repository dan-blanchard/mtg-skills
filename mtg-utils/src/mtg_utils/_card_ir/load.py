"""Runtime loader for the Card IR cache sidecar.

The sidecar is a JSON ``{version, phase_tag, cards: {oracle_id: Card.to_dict()}}``
written by ``_card_ir.build``. Consumers join their Scryfall record to the IR by
``oracle_id`` and read structured abilities instead of re-grepping oracle text.

An in-memory cache (keyed by path + mtime) makes repeated lookups in one process
free — a tune issues many searches, each of which wants the IR, so without this
we'd re-parse the sidecar every call (mirrors ``bulk_loader``'s rationale).

#   EXCLUDED and a dynamic "base power … equal to X" (variable_pt CDA) is NOT claimed.
#   Plus a supplement `_recover_static_pattern` arm: a static the parser FAILED (Curse
#   of Conformity / Overwhelming Splendor "have base power and toughness N/N") →
#   base_pt_set before the grant fallback. Carves ONLY the fixed base-P/T-set mechanic
#   (CR 613.4b layer 7b) out of the 4-mechanic regex umbrella — switch (613.4d layer 7d)
#   and pure type-conferral (205.1b) stay distinct, NOT re-absorbed. The lane reads it.
# v33 (ADR-0027 Cluster C — per-clause draw raw, project.py `_recover_count_operand`
#   + `Effect.clause_raw`): a draw effect's whole-ability `raw` can span a SEPARATE
#   "for each" / "equal to the number of" clause that scales a sibling cost / damage /
#   life / token rider, NOT the draw — a fixed "Draw a card" sharing the ability with
#   "...costs {1} less to activate for each artifact" (Tamiyo's Logbook), "...then you
#   lose life equal to the number of cards" (Castle Locthwain), or a "For each nonland
#   card revealed … then each player draws a card" Parley rider. The count-operand
#   recovery now scans the draw's OWN sub-clause (`_draw_local_raw` — split at
#   sentence / activation-cost ":" / ", then" boundaries, keep the draw-verb segment)
#   instead of the whole raw, so a sibling-clause scaler no longer mis-lifts the fixed
#   draw to op='count' (the ~40-card draw_for_each over-fire). The draw-local clause is
#   stamped on `Effect.clause_raw` (only when a STRICT sub-clause of `raw`; empty ⇒
#   single-clause draw, byte-identical to v31) so the signals draw_for_each arm replays
#   the same locality (_is_scaling_count over clause_raw, not raw). PUMP keeps the
#   whole-raw scan (scaling_pump migrated at v31 breadth — behavior-neutral). The
#   genuine same-clause scalers ("draw an additional card for each quest counter", "For
#   each opponent who can't, you draw a card") still lift. CR 107.3.
# v34 (ADR-0027 Cluster C — returns_to=battlefield dimension on the exile Effect,
#   project.py `_recover_blink_returns_to` + `Effect.returns_to`): phase folds a
#   single-target "exile target X, return it" into TWO effects in one ability — an
#   exile half (`cat='exile'` controller=any, or `cat='blink'` controller=you, carrying
#   `to:exile`) and a sibling return half carrying `to:battlefield`. The exile half is
#   structurally == an O-Ring permanent-exile, so the blink_flicker lane's old
#   `cat=='blink'` arm OVER-FIRED on exile-as-resource cards (Chrome Mox / Bottled
#   Cloister / Helvault — exile with NO same-ability battlefield return) and MISSED
#   genuine blinks phase types `cat='exile'` because the exiled object isn't "you"-
#   controlled (Flickerwisp / Mistmeadow Witch / Roon / Eldrazi Displacer). The new
#   pass stamps `returns_to="battlefield"` on the exile half iff a SIBLING effect in the
#   same ability lands the object back on the battlefield; the blink_flicker arm now
#   REQUIRES it. Empty ⇒ byte-identical to v33 (set only on the genuine same-ability
#   blink). A delayed-return O-Ring whose return is a SEPARATE leaves-the-battlefield
#   ability (Fiend Hunter, Journey to Nowhere) keeps it empty — correctly exile_removal,
#   not a blink. CR 603.6e / 400.7 (a returned object is a NEW object).
# v35 (ADR-0027 Cluster D — granted keyword on the single_target_grant marker,
#   project.py `_single_target_grant_counter_kind`): a "target creature gains <kw>"
#   spell/ability already re-surfaces as a `single_target_grant` Effect (the v14
#   keyword_grant_target projection), but its `counter_kind` was EMPTY — so the
#   protection_grant lane could not tell "target creature gains protection from red"
#   (Benevolent Bodyguard, Blessed Breath) from "target creature gains menace". The
#   marker now carries the FIRST PROTECTIVE granted keyword (hexproof / shroud /
#   indestructible / ward / protection — normalized from phase's AddKeyword `keyword`,
#   which is a bare string OR a parameterized dict {"Protection": {...}}), else the
#   first keyword. keyword_grant_target reads category (not counter_kind), so it is
#   unchanged; only the new protection_grant single-target arm reads the field. Empty
#   ⇒ byte-identical to v34 for non-grant effects. CR 700.2 / 702.11/16/12/18/21.
# v36 (ADR-0027 Cluster D — the attacker-side `becomes_blocked` trigger event,
#   project.py `_trigger_event`): phase carries the BECOMES-BLOCKED event (the
#   ATTACKER that got blocked, CR 509.3c / 509.1h) as distinct modes —
#   `BecomesBlocked` (the textual trigger + Rampage/Bushido/Flanking/Infect reminder
#   triggers) and `AttackerBlocked` (Afflict, CR 702.131) — but `_trigger_event`
#   FOLDED both into the generic `blocks` event, merging them with the BLOCKER-side
#   `Blocks` trigger (CR 509.3a — the creature doing the blocking). They are distinct
#   events (same declare-blockers step, opposite roles), so this splits them:
#   `becomes_blocked` (attacker payoff → blocked_matters) vs `blocks` (blocker side).
#   No migrated key read the `blocks` event, so the split is behavior-neutral for the
#   297 siblings; only blocked_matters reads the new event. CR 509.3c/d, 702.45a
#   (Bushido), 702.25a (Flanking), 702.131 (Afflict).
# v37 (ADR-0027 reveal/dig-v2 — cheat_into_play source recovery, project.py
#   `_recover_cheat_into_play_source`): phase structures "put a card onto the
#   battlefield from library/reveal/hand" INCONSISTENTLY — the put-onto-battlefield
#   lands on `reveal`/`exile`/`mill`/`choose`/`blink`/`tutor` effects with the
#   `to:battlefield` destination and the library/hand ORIGIN scattered across DIFFERENT
#   sibling effects (Call of the Wild = two `reveal`s; Lord of the Void = two `exile`s;
#   Mass Polymorph = exile+blink+exile) or dropped entirely (Impromptu Raid). This
#   APPENDS one canonical `cheat_play`+`from:<top|library|hand>`+`to:battlefield` marker
#   per ability that genuinely cheats a NON-LAND card onto the battlefield from a
#   NON-graveyard source, so the cheat_into_play arm reads ONE shape. Append-only: the
#   scattered originals are untouched, so every sibling lane (mill_matters,
#   exile_removal, graveyard_matters, blink_flicker, extra_land_drop) is behavior-
#   neutral (the marker carries no from:graveyard → never opens graveyard_matters, and
#   a Land-only put is gated out → never opens extra_land_drop). The graveyard-ONLY put
#   stays `reanimate` (reanimation, CR 110.2a/400.7 distinct ORIGIN), routed to the
#   reanimator lane, NOT cheat_into_play. CR 110.2a / 400.7 / 701.23.
# v38 (ADR-0027 counter/modified lane taxonomy — project.py `_predicate` COUNTERS +
#   HASATTACHMENT arms): `_predicate` had arms for HasColor/NotColor/ColorCount/
#   PtComparison but NONE for `Counters`, so phase's
#   `{type:Counters, counters:{type:OfType,data:KIND}|{type:Any}, comparator, count}`
#   collapsed to a bare "Counters" (KIND + comparator dropped). The +1/+1 lane read
#   that kind-less token as +1/+1, so the +1/+1 lane OVER-FIRED on ~53 non-+1/+1
#   commander-legal cards (M1M1 x9, time/bounty/fate/oil, ice/blaze/corruption/...) AND
#   on 3 EQ:0 "creature with NO counter" anti-synergy gates (Heartless Act, Damning
#   Verdict, Hazardous Conditions). The COUNTERS arm now emits `Counters:<KIND>:<CMP>:
#   <N>` (KIND in P1P1/M1M1/Any/oil/stun/time/bounty/...), so the reads route by
#   kind+comparator: P1P1:GE -> plus_one_matters (counters_matter RENAMED — it stays
#   the +1/+1 lane), M1M1:GE -> minus_counters_matter, oil/shield/rad/ki -> their
#   lanes, the named singletons -> named_counter_misc, Any:GE -> the NEW
#   any_counter_matters (kind-agnostic), EQ:0 -> no +1/+1 fire (the inverse). The
#   HASATTACHMENT arm emits `HasAttachment:<kind>` / `HasAnyAttachmentOf:<k1>|<k2>` for
#   the equipped/enchanted half of the CR-700.9 modified union; modified_matters reads
#   phase's direct `Modified` predicate (phase DERIVES the union itself). CR 122.1 /
#   122.1a / 122.3 (counters individuated, +1/+1 vs -1/-1 distinct and opposed) / 700.9
#   (modified) / 301.5 / 303.4 / 701.34a (proliferate — kind-agnostic).
# v39 (ADR-0027 predicate-discriminant preservation — project.py `_predicate`
#   Owned/Cmc/SharesQuality/AnyOf/Not arms + `_zone_tags` trigger-subject scan +
#   `_cost_string` Craft-materials GY tag): every structured property carrying its
#   discriminant on a field OTHER than `value` fell through to a bare `str(ptype)`,
#   DROPPING the discriminant. New arms:
#     - OWNED (R2): `{type:Owned, controller:You|Opponent|ScopedPlayer|TargetPlayer}`
#       → `Owned:you` / `Owned:opp` (CR 108.3 owner ≠ CR 110.2 controller). The
#       consuming lanes now read the qualified token: control_exchange requires
#       `Owned:you` (a self-exchange), exile_removal's blink-exclusion excludes only
#       `Owned:you`. Oblivion Sower (TargetPlayer → Owned:opp = theft/ramp), the
#       each-player mass reanimators (Living End/Death, Scrap Mastery — ScopedPlayer)
#       and Rona's hand-cage (ScopedPlayer) STOP firing control_exchange.
#     - CMC (P1): `{type:Cmc, comparator, value}` → `Cmc:<CMP>:<N>` (dynamic → "*").
#       NO lane reads Cmc — pure preservation, zero firing change.
#     - SHARESQUALITY (MISS#2): `{type:SharesQuality, quality}` → `SharesQuality:
#       <quality>` (CreatureType/CardType/Color/LandType/Name) so a tribal read can
#       require CreatureType. No lane reads it — preservation.
#     - property-level ANYOF / NOT (MISS#4): a `properties`-level `{type:AnyOf,
#       props:[...]}` / `{type:Not, filter:{...}}` (Aether Gust's "red or green")
#       was invisible to `_composite_predicates` (type_filter-only). Now recovered as
#       `AnyOf:<m1>|<m2>` / `Not:<member>`.
#   `_zone_tags` adds `valid_card` to the InZone-bearing keys → a trigger subject
#   restricted IN a graveyard ("a card in your graveyard is …" — Veteran
#   Ghoulcaller) surfaces `in:graveyard`, read by the trigger-zone gy_matters arm.
#   `_cost_string` surfaces `exilegrave` for a Craft `ExileMaterials` cost whose
#   materials Or-filter has an `InZone:Graveyard` arm (Braided Net/Dire Flail —
#   exile a GY card as crafting fuel), routing the ~14 graveyard-Craft cards to
#   graveyard_matters via the existing exilegrave consumer. CR 108.3 / 110.2 /
