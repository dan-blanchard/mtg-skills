"""Layer-2 concept overlay over the lossless typed substrate (ADR-0035, Stage 2).

The crosswalk is a **tree-preserving** decoration over the codegen'd typed mirror
(``_card_ir/mirror``): it reads the typed substrate by ``isinstance`` / typed
attribute access — never re-greps oracle text, never bypasses to a stringly-keyed
dict — and hangs a :class:`ConceptNode` off every effect's preserved tree
position. Each concept-node is either a **recognized concept** (``draw`` /
``discard`` / ``make_token`` / ``win_game`` / …) or an ``other`` concept **carrying
the verbatim typed node** (the lossless hatch — categorically different from a
verbatim-*text* ``raw`` that forces re-regex; the structured node is preserved).

It is **additive / shadow-only** (ADR-0035 Stage 2): nothing in production reads
this. The live regex+IR detection path (``_deck_forge.signals``) is untouched; the
crosswalk runs alongside it for the shadow ``Signal``-diff.

The overlay preserves the **three join granularities** the lanes depend on, so a
flat-overlay regression fails loud:

* **(a) per-ability sibling co-occurrence** — :meth:`AbilityUnit.effect_concepts`
  scopes effects to ONE ability unit. ``discard_makers`` fires only when a ``draw``
  *and* a ``discard`` effect coexist in the SAME unit (Faithless Looting), never
  across two abilities (Psychic Frog / Nezahal — a combat-damage draw *trigger* and
  a separate ``Discard a card:`` *cost* live in different units, and a cost is not
  an effect).
* **(b) per-ability effect/raw aggregation** — :meth:`AbilityUnit.iter_concepts`
  exposes a unit's effects *and* static modifications together, so the animate-land
  split-subject (a Land subject + a becomes-creature modification spread across one
  static ability) reconstructs as one decision.
* **(c) whole-card / cross-face merged-key joins** — :meth:`ConceptTree.has_effect`
  / :meth:`ConceptTree.iter_concepts` scan every unit, the surface the four
  ``signals.py`` reconciliations read.

Stays self-contained within ``_card_ir`` (Layer-2 framework only — no
``_deck_forge`` import); the ``Signal``-lane derivation that *uses* this overlay
lives at Layer 3 in ``_deck_forge.crosswalk_signals``.
